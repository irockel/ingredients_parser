# Nutrition & Ingredients Parser

Small sample application showing the extraction of product information from the ingredient 
and allergen label on a product packaging using 
[Google Cloud Vision AI](https://cloud.google.com/vision). The image needs to be cropped
to the ingredient and allergen part of the product packaging. Extraction of the data from a 
full product back image currently is not supported.
